# Sharp language

This is a tiny repo to share a console application I created for myself when in need of reviewing vocabulary and other related aspects of the English language.

I believe the code is pretty much self explanatory and can be used for various languages (special character encoding aside). The file where all the exercises are stored is *material.json*, so modify it according to your needs. The executable file is *exercises.py*.

For any questions on how to run the application, issues or offers to contribute (the list of intended upgrades is long), just send a message to **anmegi.95@gmail.com**, I'm always happy to help (and be helped!).

Note: this is a **python 3** application
